Collision (formerly StarTrek: A Collision on the Frontier)
=========

A Javscript implementation of the classic Arcade hit, Asteroids. After downloading the directory, run index.html and play one of the all-time greats in the convenience of your own home.

Use the 'w, s, a, and d' keys to move your ship. 'Space' fires lasers in the direction of your current trajectory. Knock out as many Asteroids as you can before they collide with your BattleCruiser.

TODO
=========

-Rotate Ship Image in correlation with Ship trajectory.
-Link images to object radius size.
-Implement 'Game Over' functionality upon collision between Ship and Asteroid. Also, add a replay button.
-Create a scoring system which updates live.
-Feature top scores in a leaderboard.
-Add ability to fire in directions other than current trajectory.
-Add multiple difficulties with varying Asteroid numbers, sizes, and speeds.
-Have asteroids split into smaller pieces upon destruction/collision.
-Add power-ups and rewards.
